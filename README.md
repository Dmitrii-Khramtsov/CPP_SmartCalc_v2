## Introduction

SmartCalc v2.0 is an advanced calculator developed in C++ using the C++17 standard. The program is implemented using the MVC pattern and includes support for calculating arithmetic expressions with priorities, mathematical functions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.), the use of variable ùë•, and plotting function graphs. It also includes credit and deposit calculators.

### Key Features

- **Programming Language**: C++ standard C++17
- **Project Structure**: The program code is located in the `src` folder
- **Coding Style**: Google Style was followed while writing the code
- **Namespace**: Classes are implemented within the `s21` namespace
- **Testing**: Full unit test coverage of modules related to expression calculation using the GTest library
- **Build**: Configured using Makefile with standard GNU program targets: `all`, `install`, `uninstall`, `clean`, `dvi`, `dist`, `tests`
- **Graphical Interface**: Implementation with a graphical user interface based on the Qt GUI library

### MVC Pattern

The MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern divides the application into three components:

- **Model**: Stores data and business logic, performs calculations.
- **Controller**: Processes user actions and modifies the model.
- **View**: Displays data and provides an interface for user interaction.

### Implementation Principles

- No business logic code in the view code.
- No interface code in the controller and model.
- The controller is thin, acting as a linking element between the interface and the model.

This separation allows isolating business logic from the interface, simplifying changes and extending functionality.

## Additional Features

### Credit Calculator

A special "credit calculator" mode is provided:
**Input:** Total loan amount, term, interest rate, type (annuity, differentiated)
**Output:** Monthly payment, overpayment on the loan, total payment

### Deposit Calculator

A special "deposit yield calculator" mode is provided:

**Input:** Deposit amount, placement term, interest rate, tax rate, payment frequency, interest capitalization, list of replenishments, list of partial withdrawals
**Output:** Accrued interest, tax amount, amount on deposit at the end of the term
